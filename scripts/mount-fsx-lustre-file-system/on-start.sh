#   2. The FSx for Lustre file system is accessible from the Notebook Instance
#       - The Notebook Instance has to be created on the same VPN as the FSx for Lustre file system
#       - The subnets and security groups have to be properly set up
#   3. Set the FSX_DNS_NAME parameter below to the DNS name of the FSx for Lustre file system.
#   4. Set the FSX_MOUNT_NAME parameter below to the Mount name of the FSx for Lustre file system.

sudo yum install -y lustre-client

# Now we can create the mount point and mount the file system
sudo mkdir /fsx
